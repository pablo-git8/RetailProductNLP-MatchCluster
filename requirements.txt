Future Work:

. Modify the pipeline to be able to read more files from retailers C, D, E, etc. from different folders to add flexibility.
. Trying a clustering method based on similarities or data processing for better clustering performance
. Trying graph algorithms for clusterinf purposes
. Trying differet dimentaionality reduction techniques
. Optimize the text_tokenization function to include different regular expressions and larger language models in english or different languages for increasing the scope and at the end improve the clusterization
. Experiment with Experiment with different parameters in TfidfVectorizer, such as max_df, min_df, and ngram_range, to optimize the TF-IDF representation
. Exploring different thresholds to define simlarities in the entity matching part
. Trying graphs analysis for checking for performance and clustering performance
. Trying different algorithms for clustering like aggromerative clustering or hierarchical clustering.
. Better metics for clustering analysis, at the moment the number of unrecognized clusters as an analytical measure and qualitatve inspection is implemented
. Adding instructions on how to run the pipeline in the README.md file
. Adding indexing and markdown work on development notebooks
