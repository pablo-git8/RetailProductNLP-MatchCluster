    "Imagine yourself as a data scientist at **Retailer A**, a prominent department store chain. Retailer A has recently formed a strategic alliance with **Retailer B**, an online e-commerce platform that specializes in selling products. As part of this collaboration, Retailer B has generously shared its dataset containing product descriptions with Retailer A. The primary objectives are to facilitate cross-promotion, establish a comprehensive product index, and enhance targeted marketing efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your primary task is to conduct **entity resolution**, commonly referred to as record linkage, on these datasets. The overarching objective is to pinpoint which products featured in Retailer B's dataset correspond to products available at Retailer A. This critical task will empower the marketing department to craft highly tailored product offering campaigns and refine product indexing.\n",

    "### Entity Resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of information systems, data often harbors various forms of errors, including inconsistencies, missing values, outdated information, typos, and duplications. To rectify these issues and ensure the quality of data, data cleaning (also known as curation) and deduplication (commonly referred to as entity resolution) methods are employed in both research and industry projects. Entity resolution, in particular, presents a formidable challenge due to its computational complexity and the intricate task of selecting the most suitable method for comparing records and calculating their similarities. The similarity between two records is a composite value derived from the similarities between individual attribute values.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that an entity resolution (ER) pipeline comprises four fundamental tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Blocking** (a.k.a. indexing): This step organizes records into groups, each containing records that may potentially be duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Block processing** (a.k.a. filtering): The goal here is to eliminate records that don't need to be compared, reducing unnecessary computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Entity matching** (a.k.a. similarity computation): In this phase, similarity values are computed between pairs of records. It involves comparing the values of each attribute in one record to the corresponding attribute in another record.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Entity clustering**: This task involves creating groups of similar records based on pairs of records that exhibit a high likelihood of being duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, our focus will be primarily on entity matching and entity clustering, forming a foundational pipeline that can be expanded in various ways. For instance, one can incorporate advanced pre-processing and matching algorithms or explore strategies to scale up entity resolution while maintaining accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like to delve deeper into the topic of Entity Resolution (ER), you can refer to this [paper](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3369/paper3.pdf)."

    "## Step 1: Data Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial phase in our data processing journey involves thorough data cleaning, which includes the utilization of regex expressions, the elimination of stopwords, and the tokenization of documents, sentences, or paragraphs. Factors like casing, extraneous spaces, quotation marks, and newline characters will be addressed during this process, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the execution of these tasks, spaCy emerges as a comprehensive tool that offers a wide range of functionalities commonly required in any Natural Language Processing (NLP) project. However, it's worthwhile to consider alternative packages like NLTK or even constructing custom cleaning procedures tailored to your specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended workflow for this step is as follows: Begin by importing the CSV files and subsequently apply the prescribed data cleaning operations.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the second step of our process, known as \"Entity Matching,\" we face the task of computing the similarity between each product record in Retailer A and every record in Retailer B. Contemplating the total number of comparisons required for this task can be quite daunting.\n",
    "\n",
    "One straightforward approach involves rule-based matching, utilizing regular expressions to identify matches. However, more robust techniques can be harnessed, such as fuzzy matching and string distance algorithms. For a more comprehensive approach, you can explore text similarity among sentences, documents, or paragraphs using various models or feature extractors and then calculate similarities based on vector distances (e.g., cosine, Euclidean, Jaccard similarity). Here are some models and tools at your disposal (though not limited to these):\n",

    "- **Word Embedding Models**: Word2Vec (Spacy and Gensim offer this functionality)\n",
    "- **Pre-trained Language Models**: BERT and other large language models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extra**: To mitigate the challenge posed by the large number of entity comparisons, advanced techniques such as blocking pipelines can be employed. It's advisable to explore this area once all the preceding steps are complete. You also have the option to save intermediate files (e.g., pairwise similarity matrices) to disk to avoid recomputation. Additionally, there are open-source Python libraries dedicated exclusively to Entity Resolution (ER), such as *RecordLinkage*, *dedupe*, and *Zingg*, which can be used for end-to-end ER solutions or specific parts of the process."

    "## Step 3: Entity Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "After successfully resolving entities as matches in the previous step, our next endeavor is entity clustering. The primary objective here is to amalgamate these resolved entities into a single, representative record. This process entails the grouping of entities based on their similarity scores, thereby establishing that entities or records residing within the same cluster are considered identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, you have the flexibility to employ various clustering algorithms available within the [sklearn-clustering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html) library. These algorithms enable you to efficiently organize the resolved entities into coherent clusters, thereby simplifying the process of consolidating duplicate records and enhancing data quality."

    "\n",
    "In the final step, we will save our original data from Retailer A back into a CSV file, introducing a new column named 'Cluster ID.' This newly added column will indicate which records from Retailer B, identified by their unique IDs, are matched to records from Retailer A. This operation will enable us to create a consolidated view of the matched records and assess the validity of our results through visual inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the quality of our results more rigorously, we can utilize evaluation metrics with a groundtruth database, which will be provided at a later stage. These metrics will help us quantify the accuracy and performance of our entity resolution process.\n",

    "**Extra**: For a deeper analysis, you may consider profiling the end-to-end pipeline, recording the time required to complete the task. This profiling can shed light on the scalability of your approach, potentially allowing you to plot the running time as the number of records in the retailer's databases increases. This information can be invaluable for assessing the efficiency and feasibility of your entity resolution solution at different scales."
